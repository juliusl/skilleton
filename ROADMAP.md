# Roadmap

## Background

This is rust-based tool for stream-lining building and making changes to agent skills.

Agent skills benefit from well-defined structure. Specifically, instructions that are "policies" must be before "procedures" otherwise agents can ignore or miss "policies".

Since semantics and ordering matters, it's actually difficult to make changes and updates via agents as it's possible for the agents to miss places that need updates or remove existing instructions that are outdated or contradictory. It's also difficult for human operators to see the entire skill as a whole to inspect the organization.

## Constraints
- Rust-based
- Item-based (meaning all data is identified by an item id) - More detail in Milestone 1
    - `Procedures` must be described as a Hierarchal Tree of `Steps` and `Tasks`
    - `Policies` must use clear language
    - `Policies` can be scoped at each level of the `Procedure` Hierarchy
    - A `Policy` compiler must be able to check for `Policy` conflict
- Include a DSL w/ a Visual Editor
    - A DSL enables procedural-agent analysis, a visual-editor enables human analysis
- Should be able to build and output a markdown file from artifacts
- Any DSL or config should be source-control friendly

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 <!-- status: complete -->
- Initial item abstraction and relationship definitions:
    - Two types `Hierarchy` based and `Singleton` based
    - `Policy`: A constraint or rule that **MUST** be followed. Must be a `Singleton`.
    - `Criterion`: A state or outcome that is either satisfied or unsatisfied. Must be a `Singleton`.
    - `Task`: A single instruction w/ a subject and action to apply.
    - `Step`: A set of `Task`s w/ a list of "Completion" `Criterion`
    - `Procedure`: A list of `Steps` w/ a list of entrance and exit `Criterion`
    - All items related to a `Procedure` can have a set of conditional `Criterion`, if omitted it implies the item is `Active`
    - `Skill`: Root item which should contain all metadata based on agentskills.io specification
        - Should include `Policy` items that any child items inherent implicitly
        - Will be the entrypoint for any type of compilation or analysis tooling
- **Open**: Define item ID scheme (e.g. UUIDs, namespaced paths, human-readable slugs)
- **Open**: Design cross-procedure reference model — can `Tasks` or `Steps` reference other `Procedures`? If so, define cycle constraints and traversal semantics
- **Resolved**: Added `CriterionRef::new()` constructor with type-prefix validation enforcing `TypePrefix::Criterion`
- **Resolved**: Made `TypePrefix::as_str` public for downstream display/serialization use
- **Resolved (deferred)**: Validation grouping — revisit when more rules are added; currently organized by function naming convention
- **Won't Fix**: `Cow<'_, str>` or `&str` for `Segment.slug` — pervasive API change (lifetime propagation to ItemId and all containing structs) for marginal allocation savings
- **Resolved**: Renamed `validate_references` to `validate_invocation_references` to avoid ambiguity with `validate_criterion_references`
- **Follow-up (QA plan)**: Add `trybuild` compile-fail test proving invalid compositions (e.g., `Step` containing a `Procedure`) are rejected at compile time — **Deferred**: Rust's type system already prevents invalid compositions at compile time
- **Resolved**: Added doc comment to `CriterionRef` documenting referential integrity is the caller's responsibility
- **Resolved**: Added `validate_type_prefixes()` to enforce that `ItemId` type-prefix matches the struct type it identifies

### Milestone 2 <!-- status: complete -->
- Initial working data-format draft
    - **Open**: Serialization format decision (TOML, YAML, custom DSL, etc.) — must be settled before DSL and Rust type design are finalized
- DSL implementation for defining policies and procedures
    - Initial draft file extension, directory organization, etc.
- DSL compiler and analysis tool, to analyze conflicts
    - **Open**: Define what constitutes a `Policy` conflict (contradictory text, overlapping scope, incompatible constraints, etc.)
- Item storage implementation, that can store and fetch items
- **Resolved**: Added `CriterionRef` type-prefix validation — `CriterionRef::new()` enforces criterion prefix; `Deserialize` impl rejects non-criterion; `validate_criterion_references()` provides semantic validation in the compiler
- **Resolved**: Added slug-filename consistency validation in `SkillLoader` — rejects procedure files where filename stem does not match ItemId slug
- **Resolved (documented)**: Flat vs hierarchical `ItemId` convention — flat IDs are valid for test helpers and internal references; hierarchical paths required for skill files. Both formats parse correctly; `ItemId::type_prefix()` accessor added for convenience

### Milestone 3 <!-- status: complete -->
- Create CLI to initialize, check, and build `Procedures` and `Policies`
    - Build command should output Markdown with correct ordering (policies before procedures)
- Define simple skill toy to validate procedure
- **Resolved**: Extracted shared `run_validators()` helper in CLI to eliminate validation duplication between check and build commands
- **Resolved**: Fixed N² error counting bug in `cmd_check` (QA finding)

### Milestone 4 <!-- status: complete -->
- **Resolved**: Added `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Vec::is_empty")]` to all Vec fields (policies, tasks, steps, entrance/exit/completion criteria, procedures, conditions)
- **Resolved**: Added `SkillWriter::write_to(dir, skill)` for direct writes; `cmd_init` no longer needs `path.parent()` workaround
- **Resolved**: Raised `detect_policy_overlaps` same-level threshold from 2 to 3 — two complementary policies no longer flagged as overlapping
- **Resolved**: Template-based Markdown rendering via Mustache/ramhorns (ADR-0011) — `skilleton build --template <file>` for custom templates; default template reproduces original output
- **Follow-up (M5)**: Evaluate `ramhorns` dependency weight — pulls `pulldown-cmark`, `logos`, and several transitive crates; consider lighter alternatives (`upon`, `rustache`) if binary size matters
- **Follow-up (M5)**: Add partial template support (multi-file templates) — deferred from ADR-0011 Decision §5
- **Follow-up (M5)**: Cache parsed `DEFAULT_TEMPLATE` via `LazyLock` — currently re-parsed on every `render_skill()` call
- **Follow-up (M5)**: Replace `Result<String, String>` with structured `RenderError` enum on `render_skill_with_template` public API
- Finalize all schemas and specifications
- Stabilize data model before building visual tooling

### Milestone 5
- Visual node-based editor for skilleton based skills
    - Should be able to make and test changes
    - Should be able to list and access multiple skills
    - Should be able to view/edit/add item inventory
- MCP server integration w/ skill instructions
    - Enables `Criterion` or `Policy` lookup to reduce output Markdown size
    - Enables defining new `Criterion` and `Policy` items for the project

### Milestone 6
- Initial Package and Release for User Testing
- Write documentation and user guides

### Milestone 7
- Gather usage and improvements

### Milestone 8
- Publish `0.1` to crates.io
